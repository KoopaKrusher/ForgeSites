      <h1>About ForgeSites</h1>
      <p>
        ForgeSites is a small studio focused on websites for small businesses. The forge theme
        reflects our approach: practical tools, sturdy builds, and results that work as hard as you do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you need a one-and-done Squarespace build or ongoing hosting and care, we shape
        clean, fast, and reliable sites with straightforward pricing.
      </p>
      <h2>Why “Forge”?</h2>
      <p>
        Like metalwork, great sites are crafted through heat, pressure, and precision. We bring
        that mindset—strong foundations, clean lines, and durable results.
